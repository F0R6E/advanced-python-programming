# Introduction

Throughout this unit we'll use functional programming to introduce you to different advanced concepts of Python and programming in general. Functional programming is not an end, but a mean to make your code more expressive, declarative and clean.

[Functional Programming in Python](http://www.oreilly.com/programming/free/files/functional-programming-python.pdf) is a great resource to get started. Is a short PDF that covers most of Functional Programming concepts in a comprehensive and concise way.

List comprehensions are covered in [section 3.3](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/comprehensions.html#listcomprehension) from [Dive into Python3](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/index.html) and in [chapter 15](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/comprehensions.html) from [Intermediate Python](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/index.html)

## More reading resources

##### Functional Programming

Map and filter are covered in [chapter 4](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/map_filter.html) and lambdas are covered in [chapter 17](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/lambdas.html) from [Intermediate Python](http://book.pythontips.com/en/latest/)

Finally, if you're looking for a quick reference of recursion you can refer to the [functional programming chapter](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/functional-programming.html) from the [Python Practice Book](http://anandology.com/python-practice-book/index.html)

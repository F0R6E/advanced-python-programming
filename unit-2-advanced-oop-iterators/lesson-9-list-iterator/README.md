# List Iterator

The objective of this assignment is to build a simple `ListIterator` that receives a list and its only purpose is to iterate it. It's silly and not really useful, but the idea is to reinforce on the iteration methods. Example of usage:

```python
for elem in ListIterator([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]):
  print(elem)

>>> 5
    4
    3
    2
    1
```

The code in the editor has some sample code that you can uncomment and use the _RUN CODE_ button to try out.

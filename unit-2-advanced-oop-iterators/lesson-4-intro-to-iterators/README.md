# Intro to Iterators


We'll cover iterators extensively on class. Chapter [7](http://www.diveintopython3.net/iterators.html#a-fibonacci-iterator) and [8](http://www.diveintopython3.net/advanced-iterators.html) from [Dive into Python 3](http://getpython3.com/diveintopython3/index.html) have a good starting guide on Iterators.

But if you have some 30 minutes available, I **highly** recommend Ned Batchelder's talk from PyCon 2013: [Loop like a native](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnSu9hHGq5o).

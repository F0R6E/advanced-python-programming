# Multiple Inheritance

Multiple Inheritance in Python is intuitive. To put it simple, you want to create a class that needs to extend from multiple classes. For example, if a `Car` extends from `GroundVehicle` and a `Helicopter` extends from `FlyingVehicle`, then an `Airplane` extends from both `GroundVehicle` and `FlyingVehicle`.

A good resource to learn the basics about multiple inheritance is this tutorial: [https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/multiple-inheritance](https://www.programiz.com/python-programming/multiple-inheritance).

If you read it, you'll find out about the frightening [**MRO** (_Method Resolution Order_)](https://www.python.org/download/releases/2.3/mro/). If you want to learn more about it, we recommend the following talk from PyCon US 2013: [Composability Through Multiple Inheritance](http://pyvideo.org/video/1678/composability-through-multiple-inheritance).

# Introduction

This first week starts with concepts to advance your knowledge about Object Oriented Programming. We'll start with [Inheritance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inheritance_(object-oriented_programming)) in Python.

**Please read Chapter [18](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython019.html) from [Think Python](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/index.html).**

Optionally, but **extremely recommended**, you can watch Raymond Hettinger's [The Art of Subclassing](http://pyvideo.org/video/879/the-art-of-subclassing) presentation, from PyCon US 2012.

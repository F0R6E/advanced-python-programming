# Reviewing OOP

If you want to take the time to revisit some basic OOP concepts, you can start with chapters [12](http://python.swaroopch.com/oop.html) and [16](http://python.swaroopch.com/exceptions.html) from [A Byte of Python](http://python.swaroopch.com/index.html).

And more importantly, try to do the assignments on this unit.
